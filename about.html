          <h3>About FaerieLand Rescue Inc.</h3>
          <img src="images/boydog.jpg" alt="Happy Photo" width="481" height="601" class="img_inner fleft">
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p class="fwn">
              <p><strong>How we got our start. . . </strong><br />I started out as Mari Shepherds in 1978 at Owatonna, Minnesota. My love for the German Shepherd Dog prompted me to develop a quality and respected line, while maintaining the Standard of the
                breed. My first German Shepherd Dog was Ch Rollingreen's Silky Sullivan TC &#34;Sully.&#34;</p>
              <p>I since have down sized in the number of dogs I personally own and no longer breed German Shepherds. I thought I wanted to only rescue Corgis &amp; Corgi Mixes, however, my love for the German Shepherd Dog was too strong.</p>
              <p>Due to tough economic times the first year three German Shepherd Dogs were surrendered to rescue between June and November of 2009. We now rescue German Shepherds, Welsh Corgis &#40;Pembroke &amp; Cardigan&#41; and mixes of each breed.</p>
              <p>In December 2009, it is with love that I changed the name of the rescue from FaerieLand Corgi Rescue to FaerieLand Rescue Inc. a 501&#40;c&#41;&#40;3&#41; nonprofit, it now includes the breed that won my heart over 40 years ago &#45; the
                German Shepherd Dog. For anyone who has owned a German Shepherd Dog you know exactly what I am talking about. They are your best friend, a heart dog, loving, intelligent, kind, funny, regal, and so much more.</p>
              <p>My goal when I began raising the German Shepherd Dog was to start a line that was healthy, intelligent, balanced in structure and the best temperament anyone could want. I have placed puppies and dogs with families, individuals, young and
                old over the years and I was often told "your temperament is the best we could find." Even though I have no children of my own I have managed to socialize my puppies and dogs to fit into any type of home.</p>
              <p>Over the years people have returned to purchase and now adopt a 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th dog. This I consider the highest compliment a breeder, and now a rescue person, could receive. To go from breeding to rescuing is the right path to travel
                at this time of my life.</p>
              <p>So many of the German Shepherds &amp; Corgis I have taken in as foster dogs have been adopted out to previous adopters' homes. Thank you for giving these dogs a <strong>Furever Home</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>&#34;Saving one dog will not change the world, but surely for that one dog, the world will change forever.&#34; &#126;Karen Davison</strong></p><br><br>

            <p>Founder and Executive Director
              <p></p>I joined the German Shepherd Dog Club of Mpls/St Paul shortly after I purchased my first dog from Verna Kubik in the 1980’s named Kubistraum’s Bali Hai. I have held various offices over the years. I published the Shep&#45;O&#45;Gram
              back when the newsletter was done on a manual typewrite and stencils. I have bred German Shepherd Dogs for over 35 years under the kennel name of Mari Shepherds. I feel I have the natural &#34;dog whisperer&#34; skills where I can read the
              dogs and help them to heal on the inside.
              <p></p>I have taught conformation classes&#59; been match chair various times&#59; and many other jobs. I have competed in Conformation, Obedience, Rally Obedience & Herding. I was a professional dog handler for 20 &#43; years, handling close
              to 50 different breeds of dogs in my career. I have traveled the USA &amp; Canada competing. I put a Best in Maturity on a German Shepherd in Washington state named Shell owned by Tom Turner and Verna Kubik in the late 1990’s. I campaigned
              a German Shepherd named Sassy owned by Jan &amp; Nils Anderson &amp; Verna Kubik for 2 years and landed her in the top 10 for the breed. I showed Sassy at West Minster Kennel Club Dog show at Madison Square Garden, New York in the early
              2000’s. I took Sassy to Canada where she became a Canadian Champion the first weekend out and earned her an entry in Canada’s Mini West Minster show. Sassy placed 2nd in the Herding Group at the Canadian West Minster dog show. I have put
              championships on various breeds of dogs in the following venues AKC, UKC, CKC and IABCA winning BIS and BIMBS.
              <p></p>I have been a member of the St Croix Valley KC, Kennel Club of Freeborn County where I served as Vice President in the late 1990’s. I was Show Chair person and a member of the Anoka County Kennel Club in the early 2000, responsible for
              2 days of all breed dog shows. I have been a member of the German Shepherd Dog Club of America almost as long as our local club.
              <p></p>16 years ago I started fostering a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, after 7 years of fostering rescue Corgis I started a rescue in Minnesota for German Shepherds and Welsh Corgis. I perform all the duties, that other rescues have 20 to 30 people
              doing, while working a full time job. Now, in 2016, my dream and goal of a Non Profit rescue has come true.
              <p></p>My full time job has been telemarketing sales for over 25 years.</p>

            <p>I initially heard about FaerieLand Rescue when I was looking to adopt a German Shepherd in 2014. After spending many weeks contacting numerous different rescue organizations, I was very happy to find FaerieLand Rescue and discover the individual care and attention afforded to every dog as well as the adoption process. It was clear from the start that FaerieLand Rescue put much effort into ensuring that myself, my family and our home environment were suitable not just for any dog, but for THE DOG which we were interested in adopting.</p>
            <p>Since adopting our wonderful white German Shepherd, Jasper, I have regularly volunteered at FaerieLand Rescue and in late 2015, in conjunction with the founder of the organization, we started the process of incorporating the rescue and obtaining IRS 501(c)3 public charity status.</p>
            <p>In February 2016 I adopted a second FaerieLand Rescue dog, Sasha, a German Shepherd / English Collie mix.</p>
            <p>I am a British citizen originally from London and have been living in Minnesota since 1999. I have spent my entire career in banking, trading and financial markets, originally working in London for both a British and then an American bank. The last nine years of my of my UK career were spent with a proprietary financial trading business. In 1999 I relocated to Minnesota to be part of a new team established to trade the then recently deregulated US power market. In 2002 I transferred to the alternative asset management business where I was employed as Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Finance & Liquidity for an international company headquartered here in Minnesota. In early 2016, part of this business was spun out into an independent asset management company and I accepted the invitation to be part of that team serving as Head of Finance & Liquidity.</p>
            <p>My previous charitable endeavours include 7 years (January 2009-December 2015) serving as Treasurer of We Can Ride Inc., a Minnesota based 501(c)3 therapeutic riding charity, and as a barn volunteer before that. Prior to this, I also served 3 years as Treasurer of a Florida Home Owners Association. I am a member of the German Shepherd Club of Minneapolis & St. Paul.</p>

            <p>I began volunteering for FaerieLand Rescue Inc. in 2016, after becoming acquainted with its founder, Kathy Duvall. Learning about the care, love and commitment it offers its rescued dogs as well as their adoptive families made me eager to
              help FaerieLand Rescue Inc. further its mission. I applied for the position of board member, and now serve as the organization's secretary.</p>
            <p>My previous non-profit experience spanned several years, a few organizations, and included cage-cleaner at a cat shelter; director of the dog team for a well-established rescue in the Twin Cities; rabbit socializer at Petco stores; animal
              transporter. Somehow, I ended up as a board member at each group I volunteered with. Apparently, that is my calling.

              In my working life, I was office/credit manager for a small manufacturing company for many years. After that, I managed commercial rental properties. Today I am a writer which basically means I spend a lot of time thinking and some time at the computer
              being productive.

              I share my home with two rescued dogs: Luna, a German Shepherd and Buster, a Pit Bull; several rescued cats and a tank full of tropical freshwater fish.

            <p>I have been in love with corgis since my family adopted a Pembroke Welsh corgi named Corky when I was a child, and I have shared my life with corgis ever since. I first learned about FaerieLand Rescue in 2014 when I responded to a request for volunteers to help out at a rescue event. I continued to volunteer on an occasional basis until the spring of 2017, when I joined the FaerieLand board.</p>
            <p>I am a lifelong resident of Minneapolis, and a proud graduate of Minneapolis Roosevelt High School and the University of Minnesota. I have spent my professional career working in the Minneapolis Public Library and Hennepin County Library systems. Since earning my Master of Library and Information Science degree at Rosary College in 1995 I have been employed as a cataloger librarian. </p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my friends, puttering in my garden, reading, and walking my rescue dog, a corgi-rat terrier mix named Benji.</p>

            <p>Hello, my name is Mike Blees and I have a Corgi named Mack who I got in 2016 when he was 4 years old. I adopted him from a loving family who were going through some changes and wanted Mack to get the attention he deserved. Words can not describe how much entertainment and joy he brings to my life.</p>
            <p>I first heard of FaerieLand Rescue via a Facebook group called Corgi Minnesota when I was looking for a dog rescue to donate to. After making the donation to FaerieLand Rescue, my graphic design skills were recognized and I was asked to help out FaerieLand Rescue with some projects - the rest is history.</p>
            <p>I am a graphic designer for a company in St. Paul that makes crystal awards. I went to the University of North Dakota where I majored in Graphic Design and got a Certificate in Entrepreneurial Studies. In my free time I run a small business called Team Corgi where I design and sell shirts and decals, with the main goals of giving back to rescues and spreading designs. If I'm not at my computer rocking Adobe Illustrator or running teamcorgibrand.com, then I am most likely at the gym with headphones on. I also enjoy watching hockey and football, fishing, and golfing.</p>

            <p>Hello, my name is Connie Geiger and I have 2 giant/large breed dogs.  Max, a 4 year old Great Dane and Lady, a 4 year old Dane/Lab mix – both of which I adopted 3 years ago.  Max was from a local Dane Rescue and Lady from the local Humane Society.</p>
            <p>I first heard about FaerieLand Rescue from a friend of mine who knew I loved German Shepherds and that they were my heart dog.  I have been around the breed since I was 8 years old and have owned/adopted many myself.  After losing my Reiba 4 years ago, I had to take a step back from the breed as I found it too painful.  I have been following FairieLand for the past couple of years on FaceBook and feel that I am now ready and able to interact and help my heart dog again.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am the Accounting Manager for the YWCA St Paul and have been involved in the nonprofit finance world for 25+ years.  I attended Metro State University where I received my B.A. and majored in Accounting.  I am originally from Northern Wisconsin and am looking to retire to my hometown sometime in the future.  In my free time, I do rescue work, train at my gym – powerlifting, metabolics, and kickboxing, and spending time with my family.  I also enjoy cooking, camping, and traveling.</p>
