          <p class="fwn"><p><strong>How we got our start. . . </strong><br />I started out as Mari Shepherds in 1978 at Owatonna, Minnesota. My love for the German Shepherd Dog prompted me to develop a quality and respected line, while maintaining the Standard of the breed. My first German Shepherd Dog was Ch Rollingreen's Silky Sullivan TC &#34;Sully.&#34;</p><p>I since have down sized in the number of dogs I personally own and no longer breed German Shepherds. I thought I wanted to only rescue Corgis &amp; Corgi Mixes, however, my love for the German Shepherd Dog was too strong.</p><p>Due to tough economic times the first year three German Shepherd Dogs were surrendered to rescue between June and November of 2009. We now rescue German Shepherds, Welsh Corgis &#40;Pembroke &amp; Cardigan&#41; and mixes of each breed.</p><p>In December 2009, it is with love that I changed the name of the rescue from FaerieLand Corgi Rescue to FaerieLand Corgi &amp; German Shepherd Rescue, Inc. a 501&#40;c&#41;&#40;3&#41; nonprofit, it now includes the breed that won my heart over 40 years ago &#45; the German Shepherd Dog. For anyone who has owned a German Shepherd Dog you know exactly what I am talking about. They are your best friend, a heart dog, loving, intelligent, kind, funny, regal, and so much more.</p><p>My goal when I began raising the German Shepherd Dog was to start a line that was healthy, intelligent, balanced in structure and the best temperament anyone could want. I have placed puppies and dogs with families, individuals, young and old over the years and I was often told "your temperament is the best we could find." Even though I have no children of my own I have managed to socialize my puppies and dogs to fit into any type of home.</p><p>Over the years people have returned to purchase and now adopt a 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th dog. This I consider the highest compliment a breeder, and now a rescue person, could receive. To go from breeding to rescuing is the right path to travel at this time of my life.</p><p>So many of the German Shepherds &amp; Corgis I have taken in as foster dogs have been adopted out to previous adopters' homes. Thank you for giving these dogs a <strong>Furever Home</strong>.</p><p><strong>&#34;Saving one dog will not change the world, but surely for that one dog, the world will change forever.&#34; &#126;Karen Davison</strong></p><br><br>

I have held various offices over the years. I published the Shep&#45;O&#45;Gram back when the newsletter was done on a manual typewrite and stencils. I have bred German Shepherd Dogs for over 35 years under the kennel name of Mari Shepherds. I feel I have the natural &#34;dog whisperer&#34; skills where I can read the dogs and help them to heal on the inside.<p></p>I have taught conformation classes&#59; been match chair various times&#59; and many other jobs. I have competed in Conformation, Obedience, Rally Obedience & Herding. I was a professional dog handler for 20 &#43; years, handling close to 50 different breeds of dogs in my career.

I campaigned a German Shepherd named Sassy owned by Jan &amp; Nils Anderson &amp; Verna Kubik for 2 years and landed her in the top 10 for the breed. I showed Sassy at West Minster Kennel Club Dog show at Madison Square Garden, New York in the early 2000’s. I took Sassy to Canada where she became a Canadian Champion the first weekend out and earned her an entry in Canada’s Mini West Minster show. Sassy placed 2nd in the Herding Group at the Canadian West Minster dog show. I have put championships on various breeds of dogs in the following venues AKC, UKC, CKC and IABCA winning BIS and BIMBS.<p></p>I have been a member of the St Croix Valley KC, Kennel Club of Freeborn County where I served as Vice President in the late 1990’s.

I perform all the duties, that other rescues have 20 to 30 people doing, while working a full time job.

After spending many weeks contacting numerous different rescue organizations, I was very happy to find FaerieLand Rescue and discover the individual care and attention afforded to every dog as well as the adoption process. It was clear from the start that FaerieLand Rescue put much effort into ensuring that myself, my family and our home environment were suitable not just for any dog, but for THE DOG which we were interested in adopting</p><p>Since adopting our wonderful white German Shepherd, Jasper, I have regularly volunteered at Faerieland Rescue and in late 2015, in conjunction with the  Founder of the organization, we started the process of incorporating the rescue and obtaining IRS 501&#40;c&#41;&#40;3&#41; Public Charity status</p><p>I am a British citizen originally from London and have been living in Minnesota since 1999. I have spent my entire career in banking, trading and financial markets, originally working in London for both a British and then an American bank. The last nine years of my of my UK career were spent with a proprietary financial trading business. In 1999 I relocated to Minnesota to be part of a new team established to trade the then recently deregulated US power market. In 2002 I transferred to the alternative asset management business where I was employed as Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Finance &amp; Liquidity for an international company headquartered here in Minnesota. In early 2016, part of this business was spun out into an independent asset management company and I accepted the invitation to be part of that team serving as Head of Finance &amp; Liquidity.</p><p>My previous charitable endeavors’ include 7 years &#40;January 2009&#45;December 2015&#41; serving as Treasurer of We Can Ride Inc., a Minnesota based 501&#40;c&#41;&#40;3&#41; therapeutic riding charity, and as a barn volunteer before that. Prior to this, I also served 3 years as Treasurer of a Florida Home Owners Association. I am a member of the German Shepherd Club of Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul.</p>

        <div class="overlay-content popup3"><p><strong>Shaorn Todoroff</strong></p><p>I am originally from St Louis MO.. I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Education, from Southern Illinois University, Edwards ville IL. I came to Minnesota in 1976. After finding our first house, I then started looking for our first pet shepherd. We brought a puppy home in November 1977, Jecoda's Pecos Pete, at that time I became a member of the GSDC MPLS&#45;ST PAUL. About 2 years later I bought our first show dog, Ch Jecoda' Double Trouble, CD ROM.<p></p> Through the years, I have been very active in the German Shepherd Dog Club of Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul. I have held almost every office, worked at training &#40;conformation&#41;, chaired fun matches, Futurity&#47;Maturity, stewarded matches and shows. I have been on too many committees to remember. I have bred many Champions, and I have co&#45;owned or bought many that became champions. Many of my dogs have been in the top producing stud dogs and&#47;or brood bitches. They have also been in the top 10 or 20 show dogs standings for many years. I have or the buyers of my dogs, have put titles on the &#34;other&#34; end of name also.<p></p>I have been active in rescue of German Shepherds both on a national level and a local level. I am the contact person for those members of the German Shepherd Dog Club of America who need to find a home fast, for a dog that they own, or a member of the family owns. This is part of the GSDA National Rescue Group. These dogs are placed in new homes after they have been spayed&#47;neutered. On the local level, I had helped Chell and Pat Peterson for many years. I would help them collect dogs from the local shelters, and bring them to their home. It was during this time that I became involved in the Service Dog Community. I donated many puppies&#47;dogs to the Service Dogs, both here and in other states. It was always a joy to see these dogs at Graduation, with their new owners. Love to see the shepherds working at jobs they were bred to do.<p></p>In 2009 I started helping Kathy Duvall do rescue&#47;foster. At that time my kennel was almost empty. I told Kathy I would help her with fostering. I did this for 3 years, and we placed many shepherds. In 2008 I was appointed to the Minnesota Board of Veterinary Medicine as a Public Member, by Governor Pawlenty, and again in 2012 by Governor Mark Dayton. I have served 8 years on the board and I will be resigning that position this year. I was Vice President&#47;Secretary of our family owned business, Dependable Brake Systems, Inc., for 32 years. We have closed our business effective 2&#45;15&#45;16. Now I will have the time to devote to the &#34;new&#34; FaerieLand Rescue Inc. I am very excited at the direction this rescue is heading into. I think we can do many wonderful things for those dogs who need us, and for people who need a dog.</p>

We have regularly volunteered at FaerieLand Rescue, Inc. since 10&#47;2014. We sent requests to several rescues, but Kathy definitely stood out with her quick responses, devotion to rescue while working full&#45;time, and her wealth of knowledge. We are fortunate to learn from her and are now fostering our third dog for her since 3&#47;2015. We became foster failures on 8&#47;27&#47;15 as Maska became a part of our furever family. Hopefully, he will be a therapy dog. We attended Ron Halling's Socialization&#47;Obedience Workshop and I started obedience 10&#47;2 through German Shepherd dog club of Mpls &amp; St. Paul at Lake Elmo Inn gsdcmsp.org although not completed.</p><p>We have had our own dogs since 1995 because they bring us so much joy and love. Jay ended up retiring earlier than expected, and one reason was he couldn't wait to get home to Karma&#33;</p><p>Debbie's first German Shepherd mix came into her life in 1995. Jay Ericson married into the family when Mac was still very young. Debbie got Mac from a foster family taking care of him for the Humane Society when he had become depressed and they were concerned to leave him in the kennel situation. She took Mac to obedience training at St. Paul Dog Training Club &#40;SPDTC&#41; and dealt with anxious fear&#45;related behaviors. Even when he bruised and bit her arms, she never considered returning him because she had made a commitment. He became a dog with his tail up and only put  down for age related health issues. He lived a good and long life. We then adopted a 3 year old pure&#45;bred German Shepherd named Karma. We loved her for a short 4 1&#47;2 years. She died suddenly under anesthesia 9&#47;24&#47;2014. It was unexpected and quite traumatic for us, as well as the intensive care unit at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Hospital.</p><p>As former government workers, we both passed security clearance at our jobs. Debbie was a claims examiner for the State of MN., accustomed to meeting deadlines and  productivity goals with high accuracy. Jay is a retired FAA air traffic controller with excellent organizational skills.</p><p>Jay's previous charitable endeavor as a private pilot was with &#34;AirLifeLine&#34; transporting patients with a medical and financial need to medical treatments. This charity later merged with Angel Flight. http://aircharitynetwork.org Debbie regularly cat&#45;sat and dog&#45;sat. Debbie passed the background check and completed orientation 7&#47;14&#47;2015 to become a volunteer at Minnesota Veterans Home &#45; Mpls.</p>

        <div class="text2"><a href="#"><a class="show-popup" href="#" data-showpopup="4">Kari Goetz</a></div>I am the newest Board Member with FaerieLand Rescue, being accepted earlier this year. I met Kathy DuVall through her rescue when we were interested in adopting an adorable older Corgi mix that had been surrendered. The application process was thorough, and we complicated it because that they had to visit two households; one in North Dakota and one in Coon Rapids! But it all came together and we continue to enjoy our Tala.

Previous to FaerieLand, I worked with Mutts n More in the Twin Cities. They focus on finding homes for senior dogs that would otherwise be euthanized. I’ve done transports and many, many fosters. Through that experience I learned a great deal, made great friends, and truly appreciate the love of senior dogs. <p>
<p>
My professional life includes 20 years with the State of Minnesota, Department of Public Safety, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. In October of 2015 I left that position and moved to Grand Forks, North Dakota where I became the Director of Emergency Management for both the city and county of Grand Forks. I enjoy working at the local level and find this job very rewarding. Part of my responsibilities include working with the Humane Society on their emergency plans for severe weather.
<p>
In October of 2016, my partner was offered a position here in Grand Forks which resulted in all of us being together once again in one house! We share our space with our little matriarch Corgi Tala, a Beagle/Doxie/Basset mix Toby, who is about 12 years old, and another FaerieLand foster failure, Bella, who is a Shepherd/Rottie mix and will be a year old this month.

We are fortunate to learn from her and are now fostering our third dog for her since 3&#47;2015. We became foster failures on 8&#47;27&#47;15 as Maska became a part of our furever family. Hopefully, he will be a therapy dog.

Jay Ericson married into the family when Mac was still very young. Debbie got Mac from a foster family taking care of him for the Humane Society when he had become depressed and they were concerned to leave him in the kennel situation. She took Mac to obedience training at St. Paul Dog Training Club &#40;SPDTC&#41; and dealt with anxious fear&#45;related behaviors. Even when he bruised and bit her arms, she never considered returning him because she had made a commitment. He became a dog with his tail up and only put  down for age related health issues. He lived a good and long life. We then adopted a 3 year old pure&#45;bred German Shepherd named Karma. We loved her for a short 4 1&#47;2 years. She died suddenly under anesthesia 9&#47;24&#47;2014. It was unexpected and quite traumatic for us, as well as the intensive care unit at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Hospital.</p><p>As former government workers, we both passed security clearance at our jobs.

I worked for Honeywell Corporation for many years while residing in the metro area.</p><p>I bought my first German Shepherd Dog in the 1970s. I started raising and training my own dogs and put on many titles, such as, Obedience, Agility, Herding, Tracking, and Rally. I enjoyed training and felt I had something to offer other dog owners so I began teaching obedience.
