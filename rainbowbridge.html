      <h1>The Rainbow Bridge</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>By the edge of a woods, at the foot of a hill,<br>
      Is a lush, green meadow where time stands still.<br>
      Where the friends of man and woman do run,<br>
      When their time on earth is over and done.<br><br>
      For here, between this world and the next,<br>
      Is a place where each beloved creature finds rest.<br>
      On this golden land, they wait and they play,<br>
      Till the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day.<br><br>
      No more do they suffer, in pain or in sadness,<br>
      For here they are whole, their lives filled with gladness.<br>
      Their limbs are restored, their health renewed,<br>
      Their bodies have healed, with strength imbued.<br><br>
      They romp through the grass, without even a care,<br>
      Until one day they start, and sniff at the air.<br>
      All ears prick forward, eyes dart front and back,<br>
      Then all of a sudden, one breaks from the pack.<br><br>
      For just at that instant, their eyes have met;<br>
      Together again, both person and pet.<br>
      So they run to each other, these friends from long past,<br>
      The time of their parting is over at last.<br><br>
      The sadness they felt while they were apart,<br>
      Has turned into joy once more in each heart.<br>
      They embrace with a love that will last forever,<br>
      And then, side-by-side, they cross overâ€¦ together.<br><br>
