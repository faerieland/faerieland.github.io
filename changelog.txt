------ UPDATE ORG NAME ------ (Complete)

first our name is incorrect. It should be FaerieLand Rescue Inc. I believe one person who worked on it set it back to the old name, as her way of leaving her mark....I hate people who do things like this.

------ NEW AVAILABLE DOGS (12/2/2017 UPDATE) ------

Freedom came to rescue from a shelter. He was a stray and on deaths door. He was on the euthanasia list when we saved him. He was only 37# and now is 85#. He was heartworm positive but has been treated. He has had a yeast infection in his body until recently that we have treated for over 6 months. It required medication and baths every other day. It was a constant battle that plagued him. He is now healed. He is on heartworm preventative along with Frontline monthly. His DOB is His adoption fee is $250.00.

He has been neutered, up to date on all of his vaccinations, along with implanting a microchip. He loves to play with toys, chase balls and play with his two foster brothers. He will make someone a wonderful companion. We do not recommend children under the age of 16 yrs. We do require a 6' high fenced yard to adopt this dog. We also require adopters to enroll and attend obedience training classes.

Our dogs may not live outside 24/7, may not be out unattended in an unfenced yard, and may not be tied or tethered. If you are serious about adoption please complete an application: http://www.faerielandrescue.org/services.html

You updated the rescue name...thank you
move me to another location as I am the Exec Director and not a board member
also under services, can you remove the Adoption Contract.  We don't post that for anyone.

I will get more info on the available dogs.

If I give you the petfinder page, can you take the info off of that page.  www.petfinder.com  MN312 or faerielandrescue and our dogs should come up
board members are updated thankyou

You can remove the banner with the old logo.
Choose what ever you like. I have no ideas on how to change it.

Drake needs to move to the Rainbow Bridge.

one idea I have is the # after dogs name on petfinder-is their intake number to keep track of them.
can that number be listed with their name on the website.

one last thing tonight-the "for more info" button under each dogs name...can you delete it.

and move me from the MEET THE BOARD section.

I need to be under a Exec Dir place.
