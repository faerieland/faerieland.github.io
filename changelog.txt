------ UPDATE ORG NAME ------ (Complete)

first our name is incorrect. It should be FaerieLand Rescue Inc. I believe one person who worked on it set it back to the old name, as her way of leaving her mark....I hate people who do things like this.

------ NEW AVAILABLE DOGS (12/2/2017 UPDATE) ------

Freedom came to rescue from a shelter. He was a stray and on deaths door. He was on the euthanasia list when we saved him. He was only 37# and now is 85#. He was heartworm positive but has been treated. He has had a yeast infection in his body until recently that we have treated for over 6 months. It required medication and baths every other day. It was a constant battle that plagued him. He is now healed. He is on heartworm preventative along with Frontline monthly. His DOB is His adoption fee is $250.00.

He has been neutered, up to date on all of his vaccinations, along with implanting a microchip. He loves to play with toys, chase balls and play with his two foster brothers. He will make someone a wonderful companion. We do not recommend children under the age of 16 yrs. We do require a 6' high fenced yard to adopt this dog. We also require adopters to enroll and attend obedience training classes.

Our dogs may not live outside 24/7, may not be out unattended in an unfenced yard, and may not be tied or tethered. If you are serious about adoption please complete an application: http://www.faerielandrescue.org/services.html
