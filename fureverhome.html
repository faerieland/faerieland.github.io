		      Annie comes to rescue as a shelter dog. She is full of life, all vetted including her spay, microchip, heartworm test negative and on heartworm monthly pills and on monthly flea and tick prevention.<br>
		      <br>
		      Annie needs obedience training and a pack leader. She loves to play with other dogs but no one has taught her how to play with smaller ones. We are recommending a home without small dogs or cats at this time. She is sweet, affectionate, loving and house trained. She is crate trained and dose not mess in the house or chew things up. She loves car rides and playing. She would love a home of her own and an active home.<br>
		      <br>
		      We do not allow our dogs to be tied, tethered or secured to a line to do an adoption from us. The dogs must be indoor dogs and not live out doors or roam free as on a farm. We do require a 6' fence for certain dogs or one must be actively exercising your dog or they will get into mischief.<br>

			            <div dir="ltr">Chance is an adorable German Shepherd mix. We estimate his age at 8 years and his DOB: 3.20.09.  He is very healthy according to the vet but needs to gain some weight.  He weighs in at 49#. He enjoys snuggling on the couch and going for walks. He does wonderful with his 3 foster brothers and cats.  We say he would make a perfect "townhouse dog" because of his low energy level. He "sits" pretty and listens well to commands. Chance is a bit "mouthy" and growls at play time. This is something no one should be afraid of. He is happiest when being petted and snuggling on the couch- but if you tell him to get down he will get a little cranky. He was brought in as a stray and never claimed. I believe Chance understands he was rescued and only wishes to please!   Our best recommendation would be someone who is experienced with dogs and understands the dynamics of his traits. He is neutered, vetted, and microchipped. His only wish is to sit by you- and go outside. His name is Chance because he was given a second chance at life. This fella loves women especially! Please consider Chance to be apart of your home. He is an amazing dog with many cuddles to give!! </div>

			    <br>
			    She does not get along with other dogs, cats or other animals. We do not recommend small children because of her size.<br>
			    <br>
		      We require the dogs to live indoors and not be tethered or tied outside. We do not allow electronic underground fencing systems either. A 6' high fenced area is recommended. If you are serious  please <a href="images/pdf/application-adoption.pdf">complete an application</a>.</p>

We have discovered his dislike of Men.  We can only assume his previous owner was a man or a man cared for him but did not treat him nice. <BR>
              <BR>
              He is neutered, vetted, mcrochipped and ready for adoption.  He likes car rides, going for walks, playing, spending time outside, needs obedience training, is a strong dog at   55 pounds. <BR>
              <BR>
            We are looking for a home without young children under the age of 16 years and no men.

            <p>Ricky comes to rescue as an owner surrender with a date of birth 10.1.15.  He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and has a microchip.  He is a very sweet male with confidence. He is very laid back and is easy going. He is very intelligent and learns quickly. He does not know what toys are and will chew up anything made of fabric or soft toys.  He is house broken and can be paired with a nice easy going female that is a pack leader.  He needs obedience training but already knows, sit, shake, down, wait and catch.  We require obedience training to adopt one of our dogs. We do not allow dogs to be tied or tethered or to live outside. We do not allow dog to roam free either. They need to be part of the family and live indoors.  <br>

For an experienced person, who has handled a very strong, alpha personality she would make a GREAT companion and special buddy. She may not be tied up and requires a 6' fenced area or yard. One must attend obedience classes to adopt this dog. That is how she will bond to the new owner. Molly LOVES her Jolly balls. You must own a couple of them so that she will drop one at your feet prior to throwing the second one. You have to play ball with her every day, 2x a day minimum, as she has lots of energy for a senior old dog. She is not showing any signs of slowing down. Molly is completely vetted with a spay and all vaccinations. Her heartworm tests are negative and has been on monthly preventative every year. She also has a microchip.
