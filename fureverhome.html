                  			    Watson is young, playful, energetic, outgoing, friendly with all, likes dogs, not sure about cats, no young children under the age of 16 as he jumps on all folks and gets a bit too excited when he is playing. He loves car rides and playing with toys.  He can mouth hands, arms, limbs and it can get too rough for a young person.  We recommend someone who has experience and can take him to obedience training classes to adopt him.  Since he is part Bloodhound, his nose makes him a great candidate for a "nose work" dog.

                                Lucy comes to rescue as an owner surrender. Her date of birth is 10.1.15. She is a very sweet dog that is lacking some confidence. She is spay and up to date on all vaccinations including a microchip. She needs another dog to be her pack leader and we would match her with a male dog. <br>

                                She requires a fenced yard with a 6' fence. She needs an active home where you go for walks, play ball and give her the exercise she requires. <br>
                                <br>
                                She can not be tied, tethered or left outside to run loose. She may not be an outside dog with a dog house. She must be a house dog and be part of a family. She does not know what toys are and tends to chew things up that are soft or made of fabric. She needs obedience class to continue with her training.</p>

We estimate his age at 8 years and his DOB: 3.20.09.  He is very healthy according to the vet but needs to gain some weight.  He weighs in at 49#. He enjoys snuggling on the couch and going for walks. He does wonderful with his 3 foster brothers and cats.  We say he would make a perfect "townhouse dog" because of his low energy level. He "sits" pretty and listens well to commands. Chance is a bit "mouthy" and growls at play time. This is something no one should be afraid of. He is happiest when being petted and snuggling on the couch- but if you tell him to get down he will get a little cranky. He was brought in as a stray and never claimed. I believe Chance understands he was rescued and only wishes to please!   Our best recommendation would be someone who is experienced with dogs and understands the dynamics of his traits. He is neutered, vetted, and microchipped. His only wish is to sit by you- and go outside. His name is Chance because he was given a second chance at life. This fella loves women especially! Please consider Chance to be apart of your home. He is an amazing dog with many cuddles to give!! </div>

			    She does not get along with other dogs, cats or other animals. We do not recommend small children because of her size.<br>

              <BR>
            We are looking for a home without young children under the age of 16 years and no men.  We would like a home where he lives indoors, is not tied outside and will enjoy his senior years inside a warm house. We do not recommend an underground fence for this dog.</p>

            <p><span class="fwn">Molly &#45; Senior, German Shepherd female, Queen of the Jolly Ball.</span><em>For More <a href="mailto:faerielandrescue@gmail.com">Info</a></em></p><p>Molly was born on 5.11.05. She is a senior gal and she is a beautiful female German Shepherd Dog. She has tons of energy and does not act like a Senior girl. She comes to rescue due to her family member passing away. She has a strong personality, very alpha in nature and has a high prey drive. She was not around small children, so she will require a home with no children under the age of 16 and no small pets &#40;cats, small dogs, etc&#41;. She is smart, quick to learn, alpha &amp; listens when you speak to her. She has a beautiful black &amp; red coat. Her eyes are bright and she notices everything around her. She wants to be the boss and will tell you so if she doesn't like what you are asking of  her. Since she is alpha, she will challenge your every move. For an experienced person, who has handled a very strong, alpha personality she would make a GREAT companion and special buddy. She may not be tied up and requires a 6' fenced area or yard. One must attend obedience classes to adopt this dog. That is how she will bond to the new owner. Molly LOVES her Jolly balls. You must own a couple of them so that she will drop one at your feet prior to throwing the second one. You have to play ball with her every day, 2x a day minimum, as she has lots of energy for a senior old dog. She is not showing any signs of slowing down. Molly is completely vetted with a spay and all vaccinations. Her heartworm tests are negative and has been on monthly preventative every year. She also has a microchip. If you are serious about her and meet the above requiirements, complete an application. <br><br>

            <p><span class="fwn">Morgan &#45; German Shepherd male.</span><em>For More <a href="mailto:faerielandrescue@gmail.com">Info</a></em></p><p>Morgan comes to rescue as an owner surrender. The family did not have time for him as they worked 12 hrs every day to make ends meet. He was socialized as a youngster but had nothing more done as an adult. We have been working on his socialization skills and interacting with strangers. He is doing so much better. He has attended a German Shepherd workshop. He currently knows sit, down, stay, wait, come and loves to play with balls. He is neutered and up to date on vaccinations. He is available for adoption. He requires a 6 ' fenced area. We do not adopt to anyone who tethers a dog, ties it out or uses underground electronic fences. Dogs must live in the house.<br><br>

            <p>FaerieLand German Shepherd &amp; Corgi Rescue is an all-volunteer nonprofit organization run solely on adoption fees and donations. The rescue serves German Shepherds and Corgies in need. Our network of devoted foster families provides a safe haven to German Shepherds and Corgies as they make their way to quality, loving homes of their own. All adoption fees are used to cover spay/neuter procedures, shots, worming, microchips, emergency boarding, food, medications, and other surgeries as needed for adoptable dogs.

            Your donation will go directly to providing care for a German Shepherd in need. A donation of just $10 will cover one night of emergency boarding. $25 can provide food and supplies for one foster dog for two weeks. And there are many additional ways your generous donation can help:

            $15   - Pays for one microchip
            $25   - A trip to the groomer to help a battered rescue dog show its best side to potential adopters
            $100 - Vaccines to prevent rabies, distemper, and parvo for one dog
            $200 - Nutritious dog food to feed 50 dogs for 2 weeks
            $500 - Spay or neuter surgeries for four dogs</p>
