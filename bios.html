Han is unsure of slippery floors and has never walked on them previously. But the foster mom has put down rugs to give her confidence.<br>
			    <br>
			    Her DOB is 3.29.11 and all vetted. She knows many basic commands sit, down, roll over, wait, on your bed &amp; okay. She catches treats, shakes with both paws, can crawl, loves car rides &amp; snow. She does bark when seeing someone or hearing a sound but not for long. It is more her wanting to meet someone. <br>
			    <br>
			    Sometimes can play a bit rough if you play tug-o-war. She can also give hugs and loves to be hugged and pet. She does need a refresher course in obedience.<br>

		      She will eat any food or treats but has some food allergies so we have her on a Salmon based dog food and it seems to be working. Hana is clean in the house and housebroken.

She is now spayed and up to date on all vaccinations along with a microchip.  She is sweet but a bit alpha. She does suffer from separation anxiety if the only dog in the home and you leave her.  She would be awesome in a home with another dog but not interacting all the time with the dog. <BR>
			    <BR>
			    She loves car rides. She knows sit, down, wait, learning to heal and loves her treats.  She is a little slow to warm up to strangers but once she does you will see how sweet she is..  She loves people of all ages but we feel she should have a home without toddlers because of her age. <BR>
			    <BR>
		      Rosalie was overweight when she arrived in rescue but currently her weight is perfect. She would love a family of her own.  We require our dogs to be house dogs. Sorry no tie outs; no underground electronic fences or no dogs living outside with a dog house. We do want our dogs to be safe and the ideal home would have a 6' fenced area the dogs can go out into to be exercised &amp; safe.

			    <BR>
			    Watson is young, playful, energetic, outgoing, friendly with all, likes dogs, not sure about cats, no young children under the age of 16 as he jumps on all folks and gets a bit too excited when he is playing. He loves car rides and playing with toys.  He can mouth hands, arms, limbs and it can get too rough for a young person.  We recommend someone who has experience and can take him to obedience training classes to adopt him.  Since he is part Bloodhound, his nose makes him a great candidate for a "nose work" dog.<BR>

            <p>Update: Lucy has gained much confidence while in rescue and is the sweetest dog. She is great with all other dogs and children. Her current foster homes has small children. She enjoys helping with giving them a bath and tucking them in at night.<br>
              <br>
              Lucy comes to rescue as an owner surrender. Her date of birth is 10.1.15. She is a very sweet dog that is lacking some confidence. She is spay and up to date on all vaccinations including a microchip. She needs another dog to be her pack leader and we would match her with a male dog. <br>
              <br>
              She requires a fenced yard with a 6' fence. She needs an active home where you go for walks, play ball and give her the exercise she requires. <br>
              <br>
              She can not be tied, tethered or left outside to run loose. She may not be an outside dog with a dog house. She must be a house dog and be part of a family. She does not know what toys are and tends to chew things up that are soft or made of fabric. She needs obedience class to continue with her training.            </p>

            <p><span class="fwn"><a href="images/pdf/application-adoption.pdf">Jagger &#45; German Shepherd mix, male, 3 years old.</a></span><em>For More <a href="mailto:faerielandrescue@gmail.com">Info</a></em></p><p>Jagger was an owner surrender and is currently living in a foster home where he is learning many new things! Born 11&#47;28&#47;12, he is sweet, smart, plays with other dogs. He is learning basic obedience commands and is ready for adoption. Jagger still needs some leash training, but he is a total sweetheart and loves car rides&#33; He is up to date on his vaccinations and neutered. He is so smart that he can open the outside door and let himself back in the house. Jagger would do best in a home with another adult dog to help teach him the ropes. He will require a fenced yard that is 6' high. He may not be tied outside in any fashion and we prefer an electric fence not be used. His does not like loud noises or small children. We recommend he be in a home with no one younger than 18 yrs of age.<br><br>His adoption fee is $350. </p>

            <!--<p>FaerieLand German Shepherd &amp; Corgi Rescue is an all-volunteer nonprofit organization run solely on adoption fees and donations. The rescue serves German Shepherds and Corgies in need. Our network of devoted foster families provides a safe haven to German Shepherds and Corgies as they make their way to quality, loving homes of their own.

            Your donation will go directly to providing care for a German Shepherd in need. A donation of just $10 will cover one night of emergency boarding. $25 can provide food and supplies for one foster dog for two weeks. And there are many additional ways your generous donation can help: 
 
            $15   - Pays for one microchip
            $25   - A trip to the groomer to help a battered rescue dog show its best side to potential adopters
            $100 - Vaccines to prevent rabies, distemper, and parvo for one dog
