              <p>
                Boomer is a young German Shepherd about 10 months old, with a DOB of 11.23.16. He was a stray and looked to be about 6 months old. He only weighed 37 # upon intake. We have discovered he is closer to 10 months and was starved for a long time. He inhales
                his food and his foster is feeding smaller meals and getting him to eat slower. The foster is working on house manners, obedience and house breaking.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is neutered, all vaccination and on monthly heartworm pills. He has a microchip and is on front line once a month.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not allow Faerieland dogs to be tethered or tied, live outside, run loose and do not like underground electronic fence systems. We want them to be safe in a 6' fenced enclosure.

              <p>
                Archie was a stray that came to rescue. He is a senior / geriatric dog that is about 12 years old. He has frost bit ears, hard of hearing, cataracs in eyes and has a slight limp in his rear legs.
              </p>
              <p>
                He likes to dig holes and lay in the dirt. His coat was in serious terrible condition when he came to rescue. He probably never had a bath so we have given him many baths. He has very little hair at this time.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is happy and loves to go for short walks or rides in the car. He sleeps allot. He is neutered, vaccinated and has a microchip.
              </p>
              <p>
                Archie must live in the house, be given supplements for his coat and arthitis in the rear legs. He is a very sweet old dog that is deserving of a better life.

                Rocky is our senior dog. He was surrendered from his owners when they moved into an apartment that did not allow dogs. He lost the only family he knew. His date of birth is 4.21.03. We are looking for a FUREVER home for him. He is vaccinated, neutered
                and recently had a dental where he lost 26 teeth of the 42 that dogs have. He is not good with other dogs, loosing his hearing & has cataracs. He loves car rides, spending time in a quiet home for older pets without children or other pets.
                He loves being near his person and sleeping on the bed.

              <p>
                Daisy comes to us as a stray from a shelter. She was born 11.29.15. She is a sweet, loving, energetic German Shepherd dog. She currently lives with w adult dogs and gets along just fine. She is super smart and learns quickly. Already knowing sit, down
                and sometimes a stay. She has great potential but has allot to learn. She wants to please so much to her human. She is house trained. Needs more training for leash walking. She seems to always notice the dogs and other things happening
                around her. She would make a great watch dog, protector and family member. She is an escape artist and doesn't like to be left alone. She would need another dog in the home to keep her company or she shows signs of separation anxiety.
              </p>
              <p>
                She is friendly with all dogs and people. She LOVES to play ball. She can be super cuddly and loves to be with her people. She will jump off a dock and swim to retrieve the ball or article. She would be great at agility and or dock diving.
              </p>
              <p>
                She loves to go for car rides, chew on bully sticks, play tug of war, fetch and be near her person. She does bark when she hears something outside. She loves to sleep on the bed - not the dog bed. If not given enough exercise or mental stimulation she
                can be mischevious.

              <p>
                Buddy was born 6.30.06 and comes to us as a senior. He was an owner surrender whose family could no longer care for him. He has been vaccinated, has a microchip, been on monthly heartworm pills and Frontline.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is housebroken, loves car rides, will alarm bark with a predator in the yard IE: bunny, turkey, etc. He chews on bones, chases balls-sometimes. He was once an outside dog 24/7 and now loves being an inside dog. He must continue to be an inside dog
                and live with his new family.
              </p>
              <p>
                He could use some obedience training as he does pull on the leash. He is good with a female, mild mannered dog that is not alpha or could be an only dog. Buddy is alpha. He is not good with dogs bigger than himself. He weighs about 24#. He is spunky,
                happy, smiling all the time and would love a home of his own. We feel he would not be okay with any children, since he is already 10 years old.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our dogs may not live outside, may not be tied or tethered. We do not recommend underground, electronic fence systems as they do not prevent anything or anyone from entering the yard. Your dog is not safe and should not be left unattended with any kind
                of underground fencing. They may not run loose unsupervised. A Corgi may be adopted to a home with a 4' high fenced area. If you are serious about adoption please complete an application: <a href="images/pdf/application-adoption.pdf">http://www.faerielandrescue.org/services.html</a>

                Gabbie is a sweet German Shepherd. She comes to us from another rescue organization. She is not good with cats. We recommend she be an only dog. She has a beautiful sable colored coat and is a senior dog. She loves car rides, being pet and going for walks.
                She could use a refresher course in obedience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since she is alpha we do not recommend she be with another dog or animal. She would be very happy in a quiet, older home. She will become your best friend and protector of your property.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider adopting this girl with a 6' high fenced area and she must live in doors. No outdoor living for our dogs. We do not recommend underground electronic fences as they do not keep a dog safe. Anyone or anything can enter the property and hurt or
                take your dog. If you are serious about adoption please complete an application: <a href="images/pdf/application-adoption.pdf">http://www.faerielandrescue.org/services.html</a>

                Freedom came to rescue from a shelter. He was a stray and on deaths door. He was on the euthanasia list when we saved him. He was only 37# and now is 85#. He was heartworm positive but has been treated. He has had a yeast infection in his body until recently
                that we have treated for over 6 months. It required medication and baths every other day. It was a constant battle that plagued him. He is now healed. He is on monthly heartworm preventative along with Frontline monthly.

              <p>
                He has been neutered, up to date on all of his vaccinations, along with implanting a microchip. He loves to play with toys, chase balls and play with his two foster brothers. He will make someone a wonderful companion. We do not recommend children under
                the age of 16 yrs. We do require a 6' high fenced yard to adopt this dog. We also require adopters to enroll and attend obedience training classes.

                along with all dogs and adults. He loves car rides and being a house dog. He will run if you let him, therefore we require a fenced yard for this dog.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bubba is all vetted, neutered and has a microchip. We do not allow our dogs to be tethered, tied or secured to a line of any kind. We do not recommend underground electronic fences and all dogs must be part of your family and live indoors. The underground
                fence does not protect your dog or keep it safe. It doesn't stop anyone from coming in the yard or another animal. The recommendation is a 6' fenced area. Bubba has a nose that will take him on a "walk about" the neighborhood.

              <p>
                Edgar update: He is a very alpha male. Probably would be best without small children. He has attended basic obedience classes by his current foster mom. He will play ball forever but will "lord" over the ball and not want to give it up if you don't have
                a 2nd ball. He has issues with you touching his feet and sometimes brushing him. If he does not like what you are doing - he will growl. That may never change. He is a beautiful male German Shepherd that needs a very experienced person
                to adopt him and become his BFF. he is very loyal.

                Edgar comes to rescue as an owner surrender. He was born 7.13.09. He is a German Shepherd with a black and tan shiny coat. He loves to go on walks and play ball. He has an alpha strong personality and requires someone with German Shepherd experience.
                He must be contained in a 6' high fenced yard and obedience training to bond with him. If he does not like something, such as you trying to make him down, he will growl. The growl is the pre-cursor to a snap.
              </p>
              <p>
                He loves to ride in the car and go on walks. He chases cats and does not like all other dogs. We are recommending he be an only dog. No children under 18 years of age. He is neutered and up to date on all vaccinations. He has a microchip.
