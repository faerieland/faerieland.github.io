              <p>
                Edgar update: He is a very alpha male. Probably would be best without small children. He has attended basic obedience classes by his current foster mom. He will play ball forever but will "lord" over the ball and not want to give it up if you don't have
                a 2nd ball. He has issues with you touching his feet and sometimes brushing him. If he does not like what you are doing - he will growl. That may never change. He is a beautiful male German Shepherd that needs a very experienced person
                to adopt him and become his BFF. he is very loyal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Edgar comes to rescue as an owner surrender. He was born 7.13.09. He is a German Shepherd with a black and tan shiny coat. He loves to go on walks and play ball. He has an alpha strong personality and requires someone with German Shepherd experience.
                He must be contained in a 6' high fenced yard and obedience training to bond with him. If he does not like something, such as you trying to make him down, he will growl. The growl is the pre-cursor to a snap.
              </p>
              <p>
                He loves to ride in the car and go on walks. He chases cats and does not like all other dogs. We are recommending he be an only dog. No children under 18 years of age. He is neutered and up to date on all vaccinations. He has a microchip.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our dogs may not live outside, may not be tied or tethered. We do not recommend underground, electronic fence systems as they do not prevent anything or anyone from entering the yard. Your dog is not safe and should not be left unattended with any kind of underground fencing. They may not run loose unsupervised.

              <p>Freedom came to rescue from a shelter. He was a stray and on deaths door. He was on the euthanasia list when we saved him. He was only 37# and now is 85#. He was heartworm positive but has been treated. He has had a yeast infection in his body until recently that we have treated for over 6 months. It required medication and baths every other day. It was a constant battle that plagued him. He is now healed. He is on monthly heartworm preventative along with Frontline monthly.<p>
              <p>He has been neutered, up to date on all of his vaccinations, along with implanting a microchip. He loves to play with toys, chase balls and play with his two foster brothers. He will make someone a wonderful companion. We do not recommend children under the age of 16 yrs. We do require a 6' high fenced yard to adopt this dog. We also require adopters to enroll and attend obedience training classes.</p>

              <p>
                Buddy was born 6.30.06 and comes to us as a senior. He was an owner surrender whose family could no longer care for him. He has been vaccinated, has a microchip, been on monthly heartworm pills and Frontline.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is housebroken, loves car rides, will alarm bark with a predator in the yard IE: bunny, turkey, etc. He chews on bones, chases balls-sometimes. He was once an outside dog 24/7 and now loves being an inside dog. He must continue to be an inside dog
                and live with his new family.
              </p>
              <p>
                He could use some obedience training as he does pull on the leash. He is good with a female, mild mannered dog that is not alpha or could be an only dog. Buddy is alpha. He is not good with dogs bigger than himself. He weighs about 24#. He is spunky,
                happy, smiling all the time and would love a home of his own. We feel he would not be okay with any children, since he is already 10 years old.

              <p>
                Archie was a stray that came to rescue. He is a senior / geriatric dog that is about 12 years old. He has frost bit ears, hard of hearing, cataracs in eyes and has a slight limp in his rear legs.
              </p>
              <p>
                He likes to dig holes and lay in the dirt. His coat was in serious terrible condition when he came to rescue. He probably never had a bath so we have given him many baths. He has very little hair at this time.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is happy and loves to go for short walks or rides in the car. He sleeps allot. He is neutered, vaccinated and has a microchip. Archie must live in the house, be given supplements for his coat and arthitis in the rear legs. He is a very sweet old dog that is deserving of a better life.

                his food and his foster is feeding smaller meals and getting him to eat slower. The foster is working on house manners, obedience and house breaking.

              <p>Danny Boy is a 1-2 year old German Shepherd. HIS DOB 10.29.15. He is a neutered male, black & tan in color. He weighs about 75 pounds. He is currently in the Dallas TX area with our foster home.</p>
              <p>Danny Boy was found as a stray on the streets of Dallas, TX. He was 66lbs when brought into the shelter is now 75 lbs. He was limping and still has a slight limp. We have had it checked out but appears to be an injury to the elbow.</p>
              <p>He is heartworm positive and on Doxycycline at this time along with given a heartworm pill. We are calling him “Danny Boy”, because he looked like he had come a long, long way. He is now recovering in his foster home.</p>
              <p>Danny Boy is a young and very social shepherd. He gets along with both large and small dogs (male and female). We do not know about cats.</p>
              <p>He settled into his foster home very easily. He will COME, SIT and enter his kennel when asked. He has shown a desire to play with both people and other dogs when asked.</p>
              <p>He has not soiled his kennel or room and has always eliminated outside. He seems to be completely “House Broken”. He leads well and is easy to handle. He enjoys physical contact and being brushed.</p>
              <p>His foster dad says "It is my opinion that he would be a excellent family member to a family with other dogs or children. Again unknown about cats, but I do not think introduction would be a problem."</p>

              <p>Mr. Mocha is a 3 1/2 month old Lab mix. His DOB : 11.1.17. His mix is unknown, but due to his wavy hair, I would say he has a little Chesapeake in him. He is a fun, loving, playful pup. He loves his rope toys, hard bones and dog beds. He is a total puppy, jumping around and being clumsy.</p>
              <p>
                He has been doing really well with potty training as long as he is taken out every hour. He gets along with resident dogs, big and small. He loves to cuddle up and get pets and give kisses come the night time. He has been doing great in a crate and wakes up to a dry kennel. Mr. Mocha is looking for the perfect forever home and will do great with or without another dog.</p>
