        <p>Freedom came to rescue from a shelter. He was a stray and on deaths door. He was on the euthanasia list when we saved him. He was only 37# and now is 85#. He was heartworm positive but has been treated. He has had a yeast infection in his body until recently that we have treated for over 6 months. It required medication and baths every other day. It was a constant battle that plagued him. He is now healed. He is on heartworm preventative along with Frontline monthly. His DOB is .<br>
        <br>
        He has been neutered, up to date on all of his vaccinations, along with implanting a microchip. He loves to play with toys, chase balls and play with his two foster brothers. He will make someone a wonderful companion. We do not recommend children under the age of 16 yrs. We do require a 6' high fenced yard to adopt this dog. We also require adopters to enroll and attend obedience training classes.
        <br/><br/>
        Our dogs may not live outside 24/7, may not be out unattended in an unfenced yard, and may not be tied or tethered. If you are serious about adoption please complete an application: <a href="images/pdf/application-adoption.pdf">http://www.faerielandrescue.org/services.html</a><br>

			  <p><!--Opie comes to rescue as a stray from a REZ. His DOB is 4.19.16. He is a very sweet, young male that is house broken and all vetted. He is ready for a FUREVER home. He likes car rides, playing, chewing on bones and playing with other dogs.<br>
			    <br> -->
		      Bubba comes to rescue as an owner surrender. He was in a home where there were teenagers and we feel it was too busy. His herding instinct kicked in and he wanted to grab pants legs, arms etc. He wanted to be in charge of all that was going on. He is a very sweet dog that enjoys car rides, walks, playing in the back yard and enjoys a quieter or older person home.<br>
		      <br>
		      Bubba is all vetted, neutered and has a microchip. If you think this could be your dog go to the website and complete an application. www.faerielandrescue.org under services you will find the application. We do not allow our dogs to be tethered, tied or secured to a line of any kind. </p>
			  <p>We do not adopt to folks who have underground electronic fences and all dogs must be part of your family and live indoors. If you are serious  please <a href="images/pdf/application-adoption.pdf">complete an application</a>.</p>

			  The adoption fee for Bubba is $200.

He was born 7&#47;13&#47;09. He is a German Shepherd with black and tan shiny coat. He loves to go on walks and play ball. He has an alpha strong personality and requires someone with  German Shepherd experience. He must be contained in a 6' high fenced yard and obedience training to bond with him. If he does not like something, such as you trying to make him down, he will growl. The growl is the pre&#45;cursor to a snap. He loves to ride in the car and go on walks. He chases cats and does not like all other dogs. We are recommending he be an only dog. No children under 18 years of age. He is neutered and up to date on all vaccinations.

Born 11&#47;28&#47;12, he is sweet, smart, plays with other dogs. He is learning basic obedience commands and is ready for adoption. Jagger still needs some leash training, but he is a total sweetheart and loves car rides&#33; He is up to date on his vaccinations and neutered. He is so smart that he can open the outside door and let himself back in the house. Jagger would do best in a home with another adult dog to help teach him the ropes. He will require a fenced yard that is 6' high. He may not be tied outside in any fashion and we prefer an electric fence not be used. His does not like loud noises or small children. We recommend he be in a home with no one younger than 18 yrs of age.<br><br>His adoption fee is $350. </p>

            <!--<p>FaerieLand German Shepherd &amp; Corgi Rescue is an all-volunteer nonprofit organization run solely on adoption fees and donations. The rescue serves German Shepherds and Corgies in need. Our network of devoted foster families provides a safe haven to German Shepherds and Corgies as they make their way to quality, loving homes of their own. All adoption fees are used to cover spay/neuter procedures, shots, worming, microchips, emergency boarding, food, medications, and other surgeries as needed for adoptable dogs.

            Your donation will go directly to providing care for a German Shepherd in need. A donation of just $10 will cover one night of emergency boarding. $25 can provide food and supplies for one foster dog for two weeks. And there are many additional ways your generous donation can help:

            $15   - Pays for one microchip
            $25   - A trip to the groomer to help a battered rescue dog show its best side to potential adopters
            $100 - Vaccines to prevent rabies, distemper, and parvo for one dog
            $200 - Nutritious dog food to feed 50 dogs for 2 weeks
            $500 - Spay or neuter surgeries for four dogs</p>
