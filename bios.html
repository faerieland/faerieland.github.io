              <p>Freedom came to rescue from a shelter. He was a stray and on deaths door. He was on the euthanasia list when we saved him. He was only 37# and now is 85#. He was heartworm positive but has been treated. He has had a yeast infection in his body until recently that we have treated for over 6 months. It required medication and baths every other day. It was a constant battle that plagued him. He is now healed. He is on monthly heartworm preventative along with Frontline monthly.<p>
                <p>He has been neutered, up to date on all of his vaccinations, along with implanting a microchip. He loves to play with toys, chase balls and play with his two foster brothers. He will make someone a wonderful companion. We do not recommend children under the age of 16 yrs. We do require a 6' high fenced yard to adopt this dog. We also require adopters to enroll and attend obedience training classes.</p>
                <p>
                  Our dogs may not live outside, may not be tied or tethered. We do not recommend underground, electronic fence systems as they do not prevent anything or anyone from entering the yard. Your dog is not safe and should not be left unattended with any kind of underground fencing. They may not run loose unsupervised.

                <p>
                  Rocky is our senior dog. He was surrendered from his owners when they moved into an apartment that did not allow dogs. He lost the only family he knew. His date of birth is 4.21.03. We are looking for a FUREVER home for him. He is vaccinated, neutered
                  and recently had a dental where he lost 26 teeth of the 42 that dogs have. He is not good with other dogs, loosing his hearing & has cataracs. He loves car rides, spending time in a quiet home for older pets without children or other pets.
                  He loves being near his person and sleeping on the bed.

                <p>
                  Archie was a stray that came to rescue. He is a senior / geriatric dog that is about 12 years old. He has frost bit ears, hard of hearing, cataracs in eyes and has a slight limp in his rear legs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He likes to dig holes and lay in the dirt. His coat was in serious terrible condition when he came to rescue. He probably never had a bath so we have given him many baths. He has very little hair at this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He is happy and loves to go for short walks or rides in the car. He sleeps allot. He is neutered, vaccinated and has a microchip. Archie must live in the house, be given supplements for his coat and arthitis in the rear legs. He is a very sweet old dog that is deserving of a better life.

Duke had a previous owner who had a heavy hand. We are letting him get used to rescue. He is learning to trust and adjust.

                <p>He enjoys riding in the car and chewing on bones. At this time he is just starting to show us who he really is. Time, Love and Patience is what we are giving him.

                <p>Beauty is an adorable 10-year-old Shepherd x Kelpie mix. She is vetted and ready for adoption.</p>
                <p>She may have a stub for a tail but that doesn't keep her from wagging it! She will curl up on the couch or in the chair beside me. She sleeps in bed with her foster mom but would probably be happy on a dog bed next to your bed. She loves to be pet and will stand by your chair while you rub her back.</p>
                <p>In her foster home, she gets along fine with a 16-year-old Golden mix (who wouldn't?) and most of the time with another 16-month-old foster dog, Shepherd mix, Beau. She will get a little possessive towards Beau when she's sitting near me and he comes for attention. She can be aggressive at the dog park so tread carefully there.</p>
                <p>She would do best with a fenced in yard because she rarely will do her business if she's on a lead or leash. She rides well in a car but does like to chat about what she sees. In my car she is egged on by Beau so she would probably be quiet if no one else is yapping!</p>
                <p>She's a love bug with a sweet face and Yoda ears!</p>
